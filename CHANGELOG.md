# Welcome!

This is the first release of the all new Tail Company App!
Theres so many improvements over our old app - heres the headlines

- Vastly improved gear finding, connecting, naming and shutting down
- Change the GUI colors per device and globally in the app
- Much better Paw support
- Instant connecting to known gear
- Sound support! (Early days, but very cool)
- Read the blog in the app, as well as links to Telegram, website and more
- Easy to see firmware updates
- Triggers become global, rather than per gear. What will you dream up?
- Joystick control. Waaaat?!
- Tail Co links in the app
- Lots of easy-to-use gestures to control your gear, like the volume keys
- Haptic feedback, Kitsune Mode and Fake Gear mode (for those wishing to test the app before purchasing)
- Much better handling of app crashes and errors.
- And a "Send feedback" button that lets you navigate and illustrate the issue!

  Theres actually even more than this - the best way to discover our new app is to have a really good wag.
