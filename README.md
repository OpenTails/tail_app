## Development

### Requirements

> [!TIP]
> Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows/mobile?tab=download#software-requirements) to set up a Flutter environment

#### Hardware

- 8GB of ram
- Dual Core CPU
- 80gb of unused storage (Required for Android Studio & XCode, Sources for IOS & Android apps, etc)
- 2018 or newer Apple Mac (For IOS) Older macs with [OpenCore-Legacy Patcher](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/) may work

#### Software

- Windows 11 Or MacOS Sonoma (Have not tried developing on linux)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
    - [Flutter Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9212-flutter)
    - [Dart Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6351-dart)
    - [Flutter Enhancement Suite (Recommended)](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12693-flutter-enhancement-suite)
- [Java `17` (For Android)](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?package=jdk&version=17)
- [XCode `16` (For IOS)](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) with IOS & CLI Tools installed
- [CocoaPods (For IOS)](https://cocoapods.org/)
- [Flutter SDK `3.26.0`](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- Bash (Windows & Linux) or ZSH (MacOS)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) for FastLane

### Updating EN Localizations

To update EN localization strings, the file [`translation_string_definitions.dart`](lib/Frontend/translation_string_definitions.dart) needs to be updated.

```dart
String message() => Intl.message('Displayed Message', name: 'message', desc: 'A description of the string and where it is used');
```

The `Displayed Message` is the string that appears in the UI.
The `name` is the variable name. This must match the variable name used such as `message()` but without the `()`.
The `desc` is a description of the string for use by translators.

When [`translation_string_definitions.dart`](lib/Frontend/translation_string_definitions.dart) is updated, the job [`localization_strings_update.yml`](.github/workflows/localization_strings_update.yml) updates the generated localization file [`messages_en.arb`](lib/l10n/messages_en.arb) which makes the strings available to [Weblate](https://weblate.stargazer.at/projects/the-tailcompany-app/tailapp/).

When non EN translations are updated in [Weblate](https://weblate.stargazer.at/projects/the-tailcompany-app/tailapp/), A pull request will automatically open with the changes. This may take a few minutes.

### Building

#### Preparing for build

> [!TIP]
> A pre-made build script exists at [`scripts/build,sh`](Scripts/build.sh)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These commands must be run before building or running.
>
> ```shell
> # Install and enable required tools
> dart pub global activate intl_translation
> 
> flutter pub get # Downloads Dependencies
> dart run intl_translation:generate_from_arb --output-dir=lib/l10n --no-use-deferred-loading lib/Frontend/translation_string_definitions.dart lib/l10n/*.arb
> flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs  # Generates .g files
> ```

> [!NOTE]
> To generate the base EN localization file, run
>
> ```shell
> dart pub global activate intl_translation
> dart run intl_translation:extract_to_arb --locale=en --output-file='./lib/l10n/messages_en.arb' ./lib/Frontend/translation_string_definitions.dart
> ```
>
> To build localization files, run
>
> ```shell
> dart pub global activate intl_translation
> dart run intl_translation:generate_from_arb --output-dir=lib/l10n --no-use-deferred-loading lib/Frontend/translation_string_definitions.dart lib/l10n/*.arb
> ```
>
> To build generated `.g` files, run
>
> ```shell
> flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
> ```

> [!TIP]
> If you get a flutter version error, run
>
> ```shell
> flutter Upgrade
> ```
>
> if you get an error similar to `Error: Couldn't resolve the package 'flutter_gen' in 'package:flutter_gen/gen_l10n/app_localizations.dart'` run
>
> ```
> flutter pub get
> ```
>
> if you get an error during riverpod generator such as `RangeError (index): Invalid value: Not in inclusive range 0..20491: 77535` try
>
> ```shell
> flutter clean
> flutter pub get
> flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
> flutter pub get # fixes app_localizations error
> ```

#### Building for each platform

##### For IOS

The xcode project is configured to to use automatic code signing for develop builds. make sure to open xcode and sign in with your developer account. Check the Signing and Capabilities page of Runner to verify the signing configuration is correct. Release builds are set up to rely on Fastlane to provide the signing certificate.

```shell
cd ios
rm Podfile.lock # Handles a CocoaPods error about version management
cd ..
flutter build ipa --debug
```

> [!TIP]
> MacOS may display multiple permission prompts such as File Access, KeyChain Access, Device Access (iphone) & Controlling XCode. Accept them for the build to complete. These only need to be accepted once
>
> If you receive an error that IOS is not installed in XCode during build.
> 1. Go to XCode (In Top menu bar) -> Settings
> 2. Click Platforms
> 3. Click on IOS Simulator
> 4. Click the small `-` icon near the bottom of the settings window
> 5. Click Delete
>
> If CocoaPods returns a version error, delete [`ios/Podfile.lock`](ios/Podfile.lock)
>
> If Permissions are not working, revert any changes you may have done to [`ios/Podfile`](ios/Podfile)

##### For Android

Android looks for a [key.properties](android/key.example.properties) file.
If this file is missing the apk is not signed.
A keystore jks is also expected at the location specified in the keystore.properties file.
The Sentry plugin will run on release builds and expects the sentry env variables to be set

```shell
# Build APK
flutter build apk --debug
# build AppBundle
flutter build appbundle --debug
```

App packages can be found in [`build/app/output`](build/app/outputs/)

### Additional Commands

#### Updating app icon

Place the new icon in [Assets](assets/) then update `image_path` in the `icons_launcher` section in [pubspec.yml](pubspec.yml)

```shell
dart pub global activate icons_launcher # downloads the utility
dart pub global run icons_launcher:create
```

#### Updating splash screen

Make any changes to the 'flutter_native_splash' section in [pubspec.yml](pubspec.yml)

```shell
dart run flutter_native_splash:create
```

#### Detecting the environment

In order to filter sentry logs from testing and production, the 'Environment' is guessed

- debug: if the app was built in debug mode or if the app is in an emulator
- staging: if the app is on testflight or in firebase test lab
- production: everything else

### Fastlane

[Fastlane](https://docs.fastlane.tools/) is a tool to automatically upload apps to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Inside the [IOS](ios/) and [Android](android/) folders is a fastlane folder. Inside is the FastFile which contains the upload config. Secrets are JSON files passed through repository secrets. The script [fastlane.sh](Scripts/fastlane.sh) selects the fastlane folder to use and begins the upload.

### Repository Secrets

Some of these values aren't actually secret and can be shared. Specifically the sentry ones

### Internal URLS

These services are self-hosted in a mini-pc on my tv stand in my apartment

[Plausible](https://plausible.codel1417.xyz/tail-app)
[Uptime](https://uptime.codel1417.xyz/status/public)

#### Infrastructure notes

Services are hosted in a [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/) based machine using unprivileged LXC containers.
These containers are based on [Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com/download/server) and have unattended upgrades enabled.
This machine doesn't use port forwarding, but instead uses [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/).
Services go down daily at 6:00 AM UTC for offline backups. This Can take up to an hour.

### Dynamic Configuration

This app supports updating some config values remotely.
These values are located in [`dynamic_config.json`](assets/dynamic_config.json).
The file is included in builds and updated after app launch, so changes may not appear immediately.

| Json Key       | Description                                  |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| sentryProfiles | sets `options.profilesSampleRate` for sentry |
| sentryTraces   | sets `options.tracesSampleRate` for sentry   |
